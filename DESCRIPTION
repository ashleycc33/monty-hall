Description: This package runs through a game in which there are 3 doors. Behind each door, there is either a goat or a car. Only one door has a car behind it. The contestant selects a door, then the host opens one of the doors and reveals a goat. The contestant then decides if they want to stay or switch with their selection. If the contestant's pick reveals the other goat, they lose. If their pick reveals the car, then they win. This package shows different outcomes based on staying/switching.
